                <h1>FIFA Random Team Picker</h1>
                <p>My first personal programming project. The purpose of this project 
                    is to be able to choose random teams to play as in FIFA XX without 
                    having to use the in-game randomizer. The problem with the current 
                    in-game version of the randomizer is that you would only be able 
                    to randomize teams from a single specific league, randomize the 
                    league, or randomize the country. While this system is fine as is, 
                    it may not satisfy all players, like myself. I wanted to be able 
                    to choose from a select number of teams from multiple leagues and 
                    countries, while not getting a 1-3 star team. My program allows the 
                    user to choose which teams they would want to play as, puts them 
                    into an array, and then randomizes from there, assigning both 
                    players a team.</p>
